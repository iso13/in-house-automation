# BDD: A Collaborative Team Effort

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** is a collaborative approach that ensures all members of the product team—including Project Management (PM), Development (DEV), and Quality Assurance (QA)—work together to clearly communicate and understand the needs of the customer. BDD fosters a shared understanding by using natural language Scenarios that capture customer requirements in a format that everyone on the team can understand and contribute to.

In BDD, PMs provide insight into customer requirements and business value, DEV teams translate these requirements into implementation, and QA teams help validate that the implementation meets customer expectations. By crafting Scenarios, the entire team participates in defining the expected behavior of the system. These Scenarios become the living documentation that all team members use to verify that the product being built delivers the value intended for the customer.

BDD uses **Features**, **Scenarios**, and **Steps** to break down and communicate requirements:

- **Features**: Features represent high-level functionality or capabilities of the system that deliver value to the customer. They describe what part of the product is being built and serve as a starting point for aligning the team on the customer needs.

- **Scenarios**: Scenarios provide specific examples of how a Feature should behave under certain conditions. They help illustrate the expected outcomes and ensure that all team members understand the requirements in detail. Each Scenario describes a concrete use case, often including both positive and negative paths.

- **Steps**: Steps are used within Scenarios to describe the actions, inputs, and expected outcomes in a structured way. They are typically written using Given, When, Then syntax, which allows the team to clearly define preconditions, actions, and results. Steps make Scenarios executable, serving as both documentation and automated tests that validate the system's behavior.

This approach breaks down communication barriers between disciplines and ensures that everyone is aligned from the start. Through frequent collaboration and the use of clear, shared examples, BDD helps PM, DEV, and QA focus on what matters most—delivering a high-quality product that meets the real needs of the customer.
