Feature: K6 Performance Test
  As an Engineer
  I want to be able to load test API endpoints
  So I can validate the performance

  Scenario: Perform load test on login endpoint
    Given I run a load test for "GET /get" with 3 virtual users for 5 seconds
    Then the test should complete successfully
    And the average response time should be below 200ms
    And the success rate should be 100%
